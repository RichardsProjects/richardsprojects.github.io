## Recipe Expansion Pack
*[Click here](/recipe-expansion-pack-downloads/) to go to downloads page.*

The “Recipe Expansion Pack” mod is a public Work-In-Progress (Alpha) mod that adds new items and and recipes to Minecraft. I put a large emphasis on making these items and recipes add logical features that make sense with the world Minecraft is set in. The current version of the mod (v0.1.5) adds in new items such as Wooden Buckets, Compost, Quivers, Flag Poles, White Fences, and Clear Glass. The mod also adds recipes in addition to items, these recipes include ones that allow players to easily create grass blocks, mossy cobblestone, flint, and ice blocks. If you are interested in seeing items/recipes that are planned for the future releases look at the bottom section of the post.
