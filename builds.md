## [Redstone Smarthouse 1](/redstone-smarthouse-version-1/)
The Redstone Smarthouse V1 is a downloadable smarthouse built in Minecraft that is compatible with Minecraft 1.2.5 and up. It is built in a medieval style and includes many features; like a microwave furnace that dings when it is done, villager controlled lights that turn on at night and go off during the day, an item disposal system and much more.

## [Redstone Smarthouse 2](/redstone-smarthouse-version-2/)
The Redstone Smarthouse V2 is a significant update to the original Redstone Smarthouse I made that is compatible with Minecraft 1.6 and up. It has 8 rooms, many features, and is in a modern style, compared to the first one which was in a medieval style. The main materials on the outside are quartz and spruce wood slabs which give it the “modern” look.
