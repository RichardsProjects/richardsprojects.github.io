## Redstone Smarthouse Version 2
*Download link is located at the bottom of the page.*

The second version of the Redstone Smarthouse is a big change from the first and is designed for Minecraft 1.8 and up. I switched the style of it over from the medieval stone to a modern house design. It features an exterior made out of Spruce Wood and Quartz, while the interior is made mostly of snow. The following features are included in the house:

* A fireplace that can be turned on and off
* Blinds that close automatically at night
* Skylights that can be opened or closed
* A modern house design
* A microwave
* A “shower”
* much more…
