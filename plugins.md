<p><img style="float: left; padding-right: 1em;" src="/assets/welcomepro.png" />WelcomePro is a Bukkit plugin that displays a fancy welcome message when a player joins your server. In addition to the welcome message the plugin includes a more practical use because it also displays a configurable Message of the Day. Future plans include allowing the message of the day and the welcome message to be viewed by different groups or set differently for each group.</p>
