## About Me
Hi, my name is Richard Bimmer and I am a Computer Science student at James Madison University. I enjoy running cross country and programming. This site is a tech blog and a repository for most of my projects. These mostly include mods and plugins. Most of them are alos open source and available on my GitHub.
